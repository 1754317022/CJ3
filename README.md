## SeismicLab
### SeismicLab: reserch tools to read, write and process seismic data

Remember  the following:

 * Copy file ./SETPATH/setpah.m into your working directory
 * run setpath to have access to SeismicLab codes, data and demos. Good luck

The old SeismicLab software from 1997 started to provide examples for my undergraduate courses. The old   
repository is still here: http://seismic-lab.physics.ualberta.ca/, which is no longer maintained. So if   
you want to use it, please, download this version from GitHub, which I am using.
