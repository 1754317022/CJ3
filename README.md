### SeismicLab: reserch tools to read, write and process seismic data

First do the following:

 * Copy file ./SETPATH/setpah.m into your working directory and modify it.
 * Run setpath to have access to SeismicLab codes, data and demos. 
 * Good luck

The old SeismicLab software from 1997 was written to provide examples to undergraduates taking my. 
courses. The old  repository is here: http://seismic-lab.physics.ualberta.ca/ and it is no longer   
maintained. So if you want to use SeismicLab, please, downloading this version from GitHub.
